        <h2>numb - lyrics</h2>
        <p>
            I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware

I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you


(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware

I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware


I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)

        <h2>In the end - lyrics</h2>
        <p>
            It starts with one
            One thing I don′t know why
            It doesn't even matter how hard you try
            Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
            To explain in due time
            
            All I know
            Time is a valuable thing
            Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
            Watch it count down to the end of the day
            The clock ticks life away
            
            It′s so unreal
            Didn't look out below
            Watch the time go right out the window
            Tryin' to hold on, did-didn′t even know
            I wasted it all just to watch you go
            
            I kept everything inside and even though I tried
            It all fell apart
            What it meant to me will eventually
            Be a memory of a time when-
            
            
            I tried so hard and got so far
            But in the end, it doesn′t even matter
            I had to fall to lose it all
            But in the end, it doesn't even matter
            
            One thing, I don′t know why
            It doesn't even matter how hard you try
            Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
            To remind myself how I tried so hard
            
            In spite of the way you were mockin′ me
            Acting like I was part of your property
            Remembering all the times you fought with me
            I'm surprised it got so far
            
            Things aren′t the way they were before
            You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
            Not that you knew me back then
            But it all comes back to me in the end
            
            You kept everything inside and even though I tried
            It all fell apart
            What it meant to me will eventually
            Be a memory of a time when-
            
            
            I tried so hard and got so far
            But in the end, it doesn't even matter
            I had to fall to lose it all
            But in the end, it doesn′t even matter
            
            I′ve put my trust in you
            Pushed as far as I can go
            For all this
            There's only one thing you should know
            I′ve put my trust in you
            Pushed as far as I can go
            For all this
            There's only one thing you should know
            
            I tried so hard and got so far
            But in the end, it doesn′t even matter
            I had to fall to lose it all
            But in the end, it doesn't even matter

        <h2>Crawling - lyrics</h2>
        <p>
            Crawling in my skin
            These wounds, they will not heal
            Fear is how I fall
            Confusing what is real
            
            There's something inside me
            That pulls beneath the surface
            Consuming, confusing
            This lack of self control I fear is never ending
            Controlling, I can't seem
            
            To find myself again
            My walls are closing in
            Without a sense of confidence
            I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
            I've felt this way before, so insecure
            
            Crawling in my skin
            These wounds, they will not heal
            Fear is how I fall
            Confusing what is real
            
            
            Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
            Distracting, reacting
            Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
            It's haunting, how I can't seem
            
            To find myself again
            My walls are closing in
            Without a sense of confidence
            I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
            I've felt this way before, so insecure
            
            Crawling in my skin
            These wounds, they will not heal
            Fear is how I fall
            Confusing what is real
            
            Crawling in my skin
            These wounds, they will not heal
            Fear is how I fall
            Confusing, confusing what is real
            
            
            (There's something inside me)
            (That pulls beneath the surface)
            (Consuming)
            Confusing what is real
            (This lack of self control I fear is never ending)
            Controlling
            Confusing what is real
